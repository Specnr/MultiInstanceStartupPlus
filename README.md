# Multi Instance Startup+

Startup script with automatic skin & cape switching between instances.

## Installation

- Install Python 3.7+ (Latest is recommended)
- Install the ahk package by running `pip install ahk` in powershell
- Put the cape/skin you want for each instance in the folder and name it i.png where i is the instance number (eg: 1.png). Make sure you have one for each instance, 
even if its the same skin.
- Edit the config.py to match your setup, the ids are the names of the files that your skin/cape are called under your assets folder in multimc
- To find out what they are delete your assets folder (backup anything needed), then start up an instance and go into a world. Once in 2 folders will be created,
one will have your skin and the other will have your cape. To find out which is which rename the file to end in .png and it should be viewable
